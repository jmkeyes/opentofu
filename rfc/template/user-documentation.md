# RFC-{RFC NUMBER} - User documentation

This document serves as an initial documentation how an average OpenTofu user would use the feature you are describing. This documentation serves as an introduction to the topic for the casual reader. Writing this documentation is important since the community will have a better understanding how they will be using your feature and have an easier time upvoting it.

For the best results, try to avoid passive voice as much as possible and speak to the reader directly. Try to think how a user would want to use this feature and guide them, providing as many short code samples as you can.
