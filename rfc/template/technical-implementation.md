# RFC-{RFC NUMBER} - Technical implementation

## Technical background

In this section, please explain to the casual reader the technical background of your RFC. This may include explaining OpenTofu-specific terminology since not everyone is well versed in OpenTofu internals. For the best results, assume the reader is not familiar with how OpenTofu works internally.

## Subtasks

Please give a bullet-point outline of subtasks that can be distributed to individual developers and highlight dependencies between them.

## Implementation considerations

In this section, please add the major integration points, as well as a description for any APIs (Go interfaces, etc.) you are considering for implementation. Highlight potential technical problems and challenges, and make sure to make it clear to the average developer what needs to be done. Remember, you may not be the one implementing this RFC.
